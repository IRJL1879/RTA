    "* Data visualisation\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the relatively short duration of the course and the volume of 'human learning' required, the project deliverable  is not expected to be a commecial grade application. However, a summary of the strength and weaknesses should be provided at completion, as well as possible improvements to take it forward. Hopefully though, the project will provide more than a certification and prove 'of interest' to others, such as future GA students."
