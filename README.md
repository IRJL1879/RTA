#  RTA GA Project DAT3. Road Traffic Accidents

Please read the Project Background,ipynb (Jupyter) docuemnt for details about the project.

Code is run entirely in Jupyter. modules can be run as follows

1a. RTA_Class_accidents  
1b. RTA_Class_Vehicles  
1c. RTA_Class_casualties  
1d. RTA_Class_Maps  
2 . RTA_M25_London  

1a to 1d can be run in any order as they set up the DataFrames 'wrangled' from the original dowloaded sources.

The RTA_M25_London file is standalone and can be run immediately. Unfortunately the RTA_Class_Maps uses a large json file which is blocked from upload to GitHub due to size - even after zipping. However, the reduced shape file needed by the RTA_M25_London processing has been uploaded, as has all the output data needed from the 'Class' files

The Specs directory contains details of fileds provided in the source data - and which are available after preprocessing. See the RTA_File_specifications_All.xlsx spreadsheet.
